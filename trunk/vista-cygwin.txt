(From previous attempted failed installations)
In Administrator shell
1. net stop sshd
2. cygrunsrv -R sshd

The following syntax is to be used:

Windows 7:  (thanks to David Shanks for his contribution)

Find the setup.exe and right click that icon and select "Run As Administrator"
For Windows 7, even if you are a user with administrative rights, it does not have the same power
as "right click.. Run as Administrator".

How to run sshd as an existing user (Cygwin 1.7.1 and Windows 7):

(I think for Windows 7, if you invoke setup.exe with "right click...Run as Administrator, 
the messy additional privileges tweaks will not be necessary).

1. Follow Kevin's "Uninstall Steps" if required.

2. Decide on a user account that you want to run the sshd process under. This can be Administrator as well except its disabled on Windows 7 by default (it can be enabled by running lusrmgr.msc). For these instructions, lets say you want a user called MyUser to run sshd.

3. Check existing permissions for MyUser (in case you need to rollback):

      	editrights -l -u MyUser 

4. Add additional privileges to allow sshd to run properly:

      	editrights.exe -a SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege -u MyUser 

      	editrights.exe -a SeCreateTokenPrivilege -u MyUser 

      	editrights.exe -a SeTcbPrivilege -u MyUser 

      	editrights.exe -a SeServiceLogonRight -u MyUser 

5. Run ssh-host-config (don't force the -y option)

      	ssh-host-config

6. Answer yes to all questions making sure when it asks "Do you want to use a different name?", say "yes" (this question is different with the -y option)

7. Enter your desired username (MyUser) and password when you are prompted. You should *not* see any warnings. If you do, you might not have set all privileges correctly

8. If all goes well, start sshd:

      net start sshd
          

Disclaimer: 
Do this at your risk. Since your user gets these additional permissions, it may cause a few security issues (I can't see any major issues though). More info: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd277311.aspx
